# COVID-19-Detector
A simple COVID-19 Detector and Classifier using Deep Learning
Viral pandemics have always been a serious threat. COVID-19 is not the first of its kind, and it surely won't be the last. We're all well aware of what is happening around the globe and how the Corona Virus might change the world forever.

As hundreds of research teams around the world are combining their efforts to collect data and develop solutions, I came across this interesting dataset that had the X-ray images of COVID-19 positive patients. In a bid to contribute to the ongoing scenario, I decided to get my hands dirty and make a simple COVID-19 classifier.
This system basically analyzes chest X-ray images and helps detect and classify the Corona Virus positive patients.

A validation accuracy of about 98% was obtained using ConvNets.

Note: When I downloaded the dataset, it had a total of about 150 images. Hence, the accuracy is coming to be very high due to the small dataset. It is being updated daily and I will be updating the code and its accuracy too, whenever possible.
